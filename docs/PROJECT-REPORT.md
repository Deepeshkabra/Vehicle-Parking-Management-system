I am a Computer Science student passionate about full-stack web development and database design. This project demonstrates my skills in building scalable web applications using modern technologies like Flask, Vue.js, and implementing complex features like authentication, background jobs, and real-time data management.

## Description
This project is a comprehensive multi-user Vehicle Parking Management System designed to handle parking lot operations efficiently. The system supports two user roles - Admin (superuser) for managing parking lots and viewing analytics, and Users for booking parking spots and tracking their parking history. The application implements role-based access control, automatic spot allocation, real-time availability tracking, and background job processing for reports and notifications.

**AI/LLM Usage: 15-20%** - Used AI assistance primarily for code optimization, error handling patterns, and documentation formatting. All core logic, database design, API architecture, and business rules were implemented independently with original problem-solving approaches.

    lot_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    spot_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'A',
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    FOREIGN KEY (lot_id) REFERENCES parking_lots(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT valid_status CHECK (status IN ('A', 'O')),
    CONSTRAINT positive_spot_number CHECK (spot_number > 0),
    CONSTRAINT unique_spot_per_lot UNIQUE (lot_id, spot_number),
    INDEX idx_lot_id (lot_id),

### Schema Design Rationale
- **Normalization**: Database follows 3NF with proper foreign key relationships to eliminate redundancy
- **Indexing Strategy**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns (user_id, lot_id, status, timestamps)
- **Constraints**: Business logic enforced at database level with check constraints for data integrity
- **Cascading Deletes**: Proper cascade rules ensure referential integrity when parking lots are deleted
- **Flexible Status Management**: Enum-style status fields allow for future expansion of booking states
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Comprehensive audit trail with created_at/updated_at on all entities
- **Scalability Considerations**: Design supports multiple parking lots and concurrent user operations

## API Design

The API follows RESTful design principles with clear resource-based endpoints organized into logical modules:

### Authentication Module (`/api/auth/`)
- **JWT-based authentication** with access and refresh token pattern
- **Unified login endpoint** supporting both admin and user authentication
- **Secure password handling** with bcrypt hashing
- **Token blacklisting** for secure logout functionality

### Admin Module (`/api/admin/`)
- **User management** endpoints for viewing all registered users
- **Parking lot CRUD operations** with validation and business logic
- **Role-based authorization** ensuring only admin access
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging

### User Module (`/api/user/`)
- **Profile management** for user account operations
- **Parking lot browsing** with availability information
- **Booking system** with automatic spot allocation
- **Reservation management** including release and history tracking
- **CSV export functionality** with async background processing

### Key API Implementation Features
- **Consistent response format** with success/error structure across all endpoints
- **Request validation** using Pydantic schemas for type safety
- **Caching layer** with Redis for performance optimization
